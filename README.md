## Introduction

üëã Hi there! I'm a cybersecurity enthusiast dedicated to honing my skills and knowledge in safeguarding digital infrastructures. Over the past 7 months and beyond, I've been on an exciting journey immersing myself in the dynamic world of cybersecurity.

üîí My passion lies in Security Operations Center (SOC) analysis and cloud security, where I thrive on deciphering complex security puzzles and fortifying digital infrastructures. Currently, I'm enrolled in a rigorous certification training program by Google to become a Google Cloud Professional Security Engineer, aligning seamlessly with my commitment to mastering cutting-edge cybersecurity technologies and practices.

üí° Alongside my studies, I've embarked on several projects that have been instrumental in building my skills. These projects have provided me with hands-on experience in areas such as threat detection, incident response, and vulnerability management. Each project has been a stepping stone, deepening my understanding and proficiency in cybersecurity.

üåü Additionally, I've actively participated in Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges on platforms like TryHackMe, tackled various machines, and sharpened my skills through PortSwigger Labs exercises. My journey has also led me to explore offensive security, where I continuously expand my understanding of penetration testing methodologies and techniques.

üöÄ I'm enthusiastic about the endless possibilities and challenges that the cybersecurity landscape presents, and I'm determined to make impactful contributions to this ever-evolving field.

Let's connect and embark on this cybersecurity journey together! üõ°Ô∏è‚ú®

## Objective

My objective on GitHub is to showcase my journey and expertise in cybersecurity, emphasizing my passion for SOC analysis, cloud security, and offensive security. I aim to document my progress, highlight projects demonstrating practical skills, engage with the community, and inspire others to join the cybersecurity field. Let's collaborate, learn, and grow together in this fascinating domain! üåêüîí
My journey in computer science has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst.
